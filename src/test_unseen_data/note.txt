All possible structures n multichoose k = [n-1, k]

[a, b] = (a+b)! / a!b!

we need a list of 27 elements:

first 9: only one of them is 9, the rest are zero --> 9
second 9: sum of the elements is 6 --> 9 multichoose 6 = [8,6]=3003
third 9: sum of the elements is 3 --> 9 multichoose 3 = [8,3]=165
all possible structures: 4,459,455
